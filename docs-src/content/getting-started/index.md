## Get Started

To quickly get started with a real-world example with real data you can clone the [Arc Starter](https://github.com/tripl-ai/arc-starter) project which has included job definitions and includes a limited set of data for you to quickly try Arc:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tripl-ai/arc-starter.git
cd arc-starter
./develop.sh
```
