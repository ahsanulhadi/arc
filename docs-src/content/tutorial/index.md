This tutorial works through a real-world example using the [New York City Taxi dataset](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) which has been used heavliy around the web (see: [Analyzing 1.1 Billion NYC Taxi and Uber Trips, with a Vengeance](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/) and [A Billion Taxi Rides in Redshift](http://tech.marksblogg.com/billion-nyc-taxi-rides-redshift.html)) due to its 1 billion+ record count and public data available via the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/).

It is a great dataset as it has a lot of the attributes of real-world data that need to be considered:

- [Schema Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_evolution) where fields are added/changed/removed over time or data is normalized as patterns emerge.
- How to reliably apply data typing to an untyped source - in this case the [Comma-Separated Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format.
- How to build a repeatable and reproducible process which will scale by adding more compute - the small example is ~40 million records and the large 1+ billion records.
- How reusable components can be composed to [extract data](/extract/#delimitedextract) with [data types](/transform/#typingtransform), apply rules to ensure [data quality](/validate/#sqlvalidate), enrich the data by executing [SQL statements](/transform/#sqltransform), apply [machine learning transformations](/transform/#mltransform) and [load the data](/load) to one or more targets.

## Get arc-starter

![arc-starter](/img/arc-starter.png)

The easiest way to build an Arc job is by using [arc-starter](https://github.com/tripl-ai/arc-starter) which is an interactive development environment using the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) ecosystem. This tutorial assumes you have cloned this repository. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tripl-ai/arc-starter.git
cd arc-starter
```

To start `arc-juptyer` run the following command. The only option that needs to be configured is the `-Xmx4096m` to set the memory availble to Spark. This value needs to be less than or equal to the amount of memory allocated to Docker.

```bash
docker run \
--name arc-jupyter \
--rm \
-v $(pwd)/tutorial:/home/jovyan/tutorial \
-e JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx4096m" \
-p 4040:4040 \
-p 8888:8888 \
{{% arc_jupyter_docker_image %}} \
start-notebook.sh \
--NotebookApp.password='' \
--NotebookApp.token=''
```

This has been scripted and can be called by executing:

```bash
./.develop.sh
```

## Extracting Data

From the Juptyter main screen select `New` then `Arc` under `notebook`. We will be building the job in this notebook.

The first stage we are going to add is a `DelimitedExtract` stage because the source data is in Comma-Seperated Values format delimited by '`,`'. This stage will instruct Arc to extract the data in all `.csv` files from the `inputURI` path and register as the internal view `green_tripdata0_raw` so the data can be accessed in subsequent job stages. 

{{< note title="Authentication" >}}
Because this data is hosted on the public [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/) we need to explicity add an [Authentication](../partials/#authentication) mechanism however if you are deploying into your own environment you will likely have role based access control (like IAM) and do not require this.
{{</note>}}

```json
{
  "type": "DelimitedExtract",
  "name": "extract data from green_tripdata/0",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": "s3a://nyc-tlc/trip*data/green_tripdata_2013-08.csv",
  "outputView": "green_tripdata0_raw",            
  "delimiter": "Comma",
  "quote" : "DoubleQuote",
  "header": true,
  "authentication": {
    "method": "AmazonAnonymous"
  }
}
```

By executing this stage you should be able to see a result set. If you scroll to the very right of the result set you should be able to see two additional columns which is added by Arc to help trace data lineage to assist debugging.

- `_filename`: which records the input file source for all file based imports.
- `_index`: which records the input file row number for all file based imports.

## Typing Data

At this stage we have a stage which will tell Spark where to read one or more `.csv` files and produce a table that looks like this which has all `string` typed fields.

|VendorID|lpep_pickup_datetime|Lpep_dropoff_datetime|Store_and_fwd_flag|RateCodeID|Pickup_longitude|Pickup_latitude|Dropoff_longitude|Dropoff_latitude|Passenger_count|Trip_distance|Fare_amount|Extra|MTA_tax|Tip_amount|Tolls_amount|Ehail_fee|Total_amount|Payment_type|Trip_type|
|--------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|-----|-------|----------|------------|---------|------------|------------|---------|
|2|2013-09-01 00:02:00|2013-09-01 00:54:51|N|1|-73.952407836914062|40.810726165771484|-73.983940124511719|40.676284790039063|5|14.35|50.5|0.5|0.5|10.3|0|null|61.8|1|null|
|2|2013-09-01 00:02:34|2013-09-01 00:20:59|N|1|-73.963020324707031|40.711833953857422|-73.966644287109375|40.681690216064453|1|3.24|15|0.5|0.5|0|0|null|16|2|null|

To make this data more useful for querying (for example doing aggregation by time period) we need to **safely** apply data typing. 

Add a new stage to apply a `TypingTransformation` to the data extracted in the first stage named `green_tripdata0_raw` which will parse the data and produce an output dataset called `green_tripdata0` with correctly typed data. To do this we have to tell Arc how to parse the `string` data back into their original data types (like `timestamp` or `integer`). To do this transformation we need some way to pass in the description of how to parse the data and that is descriped in the `metadata` file passed in using the `schemaURI` key and described in the next step.

```json
{
  "type": "TypingTransform",
  "name": "apply green_tripdata/0 data types",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "schemaURI": "/home/jovyan/tutorial/meta/green_tripdata/0/green_tripdata.json",
  "inputView": "green_tripdata0_raw",            
  "outputView": "green_tripdata0"       
}   
```

## Specifying Data Typing Rules

The [metadata format](/metadata/) provides the information needed to parse an untyped (`string`) dataset into a typed dataset. Where a traditional database will fail when a data conversion fails (for example `CAST('abc' AS INT)`) Spark defaults to returning `null` which makes safely and precisely parsing data using only Spark very difficult. 

{{< note title="Metadata Order" >}}
This format does not use input field names and will only try to convert data by its column index - meaning that the order of the fields in the metadata file must match the input dataset.
{{</note>}}

Here is the top of of the `tutorial/meta/green_tripdata/0/green_tripdata.json` file which provides the detailed metadata of how to convert `string` values back into their correct data types. The description fields have come from the [official data dictionary](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml).

```json
[
  {
    "id": "f457e562-5c7a-4215-a754-ab749509f3fb",
    "name": "vendor_id",
    "description": "A code indicating the TPEP provider that provided the record.",
    "trim": true,
    "nullable": true,
    "primaryKey": false,
    "type": "integer",
    "nullableValues": [
      "",
      "null"
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "d61934ed-e32e-406b-bd18-8d6b7296a8c0",
    "name": "lpep_pickup_datetime",
    "description": "The date and time when the meter was engaged.",
    "trim": true,
    "nullable": true,
    "primaryKey": false,
    "type": "timestamp",
    "formatters": [
      "uuuu-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
    ],
    "timezoneId": "America/New_York",
    "nullableValues": [
      "",
      "null"
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "d61934ed-e32e-406b-bd18-8d6b7296a8c0",
    "name": "lpep_dropoff_datetime",
    "description": "The date and time when the meter was disengaged.",
    "trim": true,
    "nullable": true,
    "primaryKey": false,
    "type": "timestamp",
    "formatters": [
      "uuuu-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
    ],
    "timezoneId": "America/New_York",
    "nullableValues": [
      "",
      "null"
    ]
  },
  ...
```

Picking one of the more interesting fields, `lpep_pickup_datetime`, a [timestamp](/metadata/#timestamp) field, we can highlight a few details:

- the `id` value is a unique identifier for this field (in this case a `string` formatted `uuid`). This field can be used to help track changes in the business *intent* of the field, for example if the field changed name from `lpep_pickup_datetime` to just `pickup_datetime` in a subsequent schema it is still the same field as the *intent* has not changed, just the name so the same `id` value should be retained.
- the `formatters` key specifies an `array` rather than a simple `string`. This is because real world data often has multiple date/datetime formats used in a single column. By defining an `array` Arc will try to apply each of the formats specified in sequence and only fail if *none* of the formatters can be successfully applied.
- a mandatory `timezoneId` must be specified. This is because if you work with datetime enough you will find that the only way to reliably work with dates and times across systems is to convert them all to [Coordinated Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (UTC) so they can be placed as instantaneous point on a universally continuous timeline.
- the `nullableValues` key also specifies an `array` which allows you to specify multiple values which will be converted to a true `null` when loading. If these values are present and the `nullable` key is set to `true` then the job will fail with a clear error message.
- the description field is saved with the data some formats like when using [ORCLoad](/load/#orcload), [ParquetLoad](/load/#parquetload) or [DeltaLakeLoad](/load/#deltalakeload) into the underlying metadata and will be restored automatically if those files are re-injested by Arc.

```json
  {
    "id": "d61934ed-e32e-406b-bd18-8d6b7296a8c0",
    "name": "lpep_pickup_datetime",
    "description": "The date and time when the meter was engaged.",
    "trim": true,
    "nullable": true,
    "primaryKey": false,
    "type": "timestamp",
    "formatters": [
      "uuuu-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
    ],
    "timezoneId": "America/New_York",
    "nullableValues": [
      "",
      "null"
    ]
  },
```

{{< note title="Decimal vs Float" >}}
Because we are dealing with money we are using the [decimal](/metadata/#decimal) type rather than a float. See the [documentation](/metadata/#decimal) for more.
{{</note>}}

So what happens if this conversion fails?

## Data Load Validation

The `TypingTransformation` adds an addition field to each row called `_errors` which holds an `array` of data conversion failures - if any exist - so that each row can be parsed and multiple issues collected. If a data conversion issue exists then the field `name` and a human readable message will be pushed into that array and the value will be set to `null` for that field:

For example:

```bash
+-------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|startTime          |endTime            |_errors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
+-------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|2018-09-26 17:17:43|2018-09-27 17:17:43|[]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|null               |2018-03-01 12:16:40|[[startTime, Unable to convert '2018-02-30 01:16:40' to timestamp using formatters ['uuuu-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'] and timezone 'UTC']]                                                                                                                                     |
|null               |null               |[[startTime, Unable to convert '28 February 2018 01:16:40' to timestamp using formatters ['uuuu-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'] and timezone 'UTC'], [endTime, Unable to convert '2018-03-2018 01:16:40' to timestamp using formatters ['uuuu-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'] and timezone 'UTC']]|
+-------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

If you have specified that the field cannot be `null` via `"nullable": false` then the job will fail at this point with an appropriate error message as logically it cannot continue.

If the job has been configured like above with all fields `"nullable": true` then the `TypingTransform` stage will complete but we will not be actually asserting that no errors are allowed. To add the ability to stop the job based on whether errors occured we can add a `SQLValidate` stage:

```json
{
  "type": "SQLValidate",
  "name": "ensure no errors exist after data typing",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": "/home/jovyan/tutorial/job/0/sqlvalidate_errors.sql",            
  "sqlParams": {
      "table_name": "green_tripdata0"
  }
}
```

When this stage executes it is reading a file contained with the tutorial which contains:

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(error) = 0 AS valid
  ,TO_JSON(
    NAMED_STRUCT(
      'count', COUNT(error), 
      'errors', SUM(error)
    )
  ) AS message
FROM (
  SELECT 
    CASE 
      WHEN SIZE(_errors) > 0 THEN 1 
      ELSE 0 
    END AS error 
  FROM ${table_name}
) input_table
```

The summary of what happens in this SQL statement is:

- sum up the number of rows where the `SIZE` of the `_errors` array for each row is greater than 0.  If the array is not empty then there must have been at least one error on that row (`SIZE(_errors) > 0`)
- check that that sum of errors `SUM(error) = 0` as a predicate so that the first field will return `true` if `SUM(error) = 0` or `false` if `SUM(error) <> 0`
- as doing a count is visiting all rows anyway we can emit statistics so the output will be a `json` object that will be added to the logs. In this case we are logging a row count (`COUNT(error)`) and a count of rows with at least 1 error (`SUM(error)`) which will return something like `{"count":57270,"errors":0}`.

Before the SQL statement is executed the framework will allow you to do parameter replacement. So in the definition for the `SQLValidate` stage there is an key called `sqlParams` which allows you to specify named parameters:

```json
"sqlParams": {
    "table_name": "green_tripdata0"
}
```

In this case before the SQL statement is executed the named parameter `${table_name}` will be replaced with `green_tripdata0` so it will validate the specified dataset. The benefit of this is that the same SQL statement can be used for any dataset after the `TypingTransformation` stage to ensure there are no data typing errors and all we have to do is specify a different `table_name` substitution value.

{{< note title="Data Persistence" >}}
A `TypingTransformation` is a big and computationally expensive operation so if you are going to do multiple operations against that dataset (as we are) set the `"persist": true` option so that Spark will cache the dataset after applying the types.
{{</note>}}

## Execute It

At this stage we have a job which will extract data, apply data types to one or more `.csv` files and execute a `SQLValidate` stage to ensure that the data could be converted successfully. The Spark ETL framework is packaged with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) so that you can run the same job on your local machine or a massive compute cluster without having to think about how to package dependencies. The Docker image contains the dependencies files for connecting to most `JDBC`, `XML`, `Avro` and cloud services.

To run the job that is included with the `arc-starter` repository:

```bash
docker run \
--rm \
-v $(pwd)/tutorial:/home/jovyan/tutorial:Z \
-e "ETL_CONF_ENV=production" \
-p 4040:4040 \
{{% docker_image %}} \
bin/spark-submit \
--master local[*] \
--driver-memory=4G \
--driver-java-options="-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap" \
--class ai.tripl.arc.ARC \
/opt/spark/jars/arc.jar \
--etl.config.uri=file:///home/jovyan/tutorial/job/0/nyctaxi.ipynb
```

As the job runs you will see `json` formatted logs generated and printed to screen. These can easily be sent to a [log management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_management) solution for log aggregation/analysis/alerts. The important thing is that our job ran and we can see our message `{"count":57270,"errors":0}` formatted as numbers so that it can be easily addressed (`event.message.count`) and summed/compared day by day for monitoring.

```json
{"event":"exit","duration":1724,"stage":{"sqlParams":{"table_name":"green_tripdata0"},"name":"ensure no errors exist after data typing","type":"SQLValidate","message":{"count":57270,"errors":0}},"level":"INFO","thread_name":"main","class":"etl.validate.SQLValidate$","logger_name":"local-1524100083660","timestamp":"2018-04-19 01:08:14.351+0000","environment":"test"}
{"event":"exit","status":"success","duration":10424,"level":"INFO","thread_name":"main","class":"etl.ETL$","logger_name":"local-1524100083660","timestamp":"2018-04-19 01:08:14.351+0000","environment":"test"}
```

A snapshot of what we have done so far should be in the repository under `tutorial/job/0/nyctaxi.ipynb`.

## Environment Variables

For testing and automated deployment it is useful to be able to dynamically change input file locations when we deploy the job across different environments. So, for example, it could be use to switch data paths for local (`/home/jovyan/tutorial`) vs remote (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tripl-ai/arc-starter/master/tutorial`) when moving from development to production.

To do this [Environment Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) can be used or the `%env` magic can be used in Jupyter notebooks:

```scala
%env 
ETL_CONF_JOB_URL=/home/jovyan/tutorial
ETL_CONF_DATA_URL=s3a://nyc-tlc/trip*data
```

The variables can then be used like:

```json
{
  "type": "DelimitedExtract",
  "name": "extract data from green_tripdata/0",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_DATA_URL}"/green_tripdata_2013-08.csv",
  "outputView": "green_tripdata0_raw",            
  "delimiter": "Comma",
  "quote" : "DoubleQuote",
  "header": true,
  "authentication": {
    "method": "AmazonAnonymous"
  }
}
```

{{< note title="JSON vs HOCON" >}}
The config file, whilst looking very similar to a `json` file is actually a [Human-Optimized Config Object Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOCON) (HOCON) file. This file format is a superset of `json` allowing some very useful extensions like [Environment Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) substitution and string interpolation. We primarily use it for Environment Variable injection but all its capabilities described [here](https://github.com/lightbend/config) can be utilised.
{{</note>}}

## Add more data

To continue with the `green_tripdata` dataset example we can now add the other two dataset versions. This will show the general pattern for adding additional data and dealing with [Schema Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_evolution). You can see here that adding more data is just appending additional stages to the `stages` array.

```json

    "sqlParams": {
        "table_name": "green_tripdata2"
    }
  }
]}
```

Now we have three typed and validated datasets in memory. How are they merged?

## Merging Data

The real complexity with schema evolution comes defining clear rules with how to deal with fields which are added and removed. In the case of `green_tripdata` the main change over time is the change from giving specific pickup and dropoff co-ordinates (`pickup_longitude`, `pickup_latitude`, `dropoff_longitude`, `dropoff_latitude`) in the early datasets to only providing more generalised (and much more anonymous) `pickup_location_id` and `dropoff_location_id` geographic regions. The easiest way to deal with this is to use a `SQLTransform` and manually define the rules for each dataset before `UNION ALL` the data together.

{{< note title="Executing SQL" >}}
The `arc-starter` Jupyter notebook allows direct execution of SQL for development by executing a Jupyter 'magic' called `%sql`. To execute a statement you can put:

```sql
%sql
SELECT * FROM green_tripdata0
```
{{</note>}}

See `tutorial/job/1/trips.sql`:

```sql
-- first schema 2013-08 to 2014-12
SELECT 
  vendor_id
  ,lpep_pickup_datetime AS pickup_datetime
  ,lpep_dropoff_datetime AS dropoff_datetime
  ,store_and_fwd_flag
  ,rate_code_id
  ,pickup_longitude
  ,pickup_latitude
  ,dropoff_longitude
  ,dropoff_latitude
  ,passenger_count
  ,trip_distance
  ,fare_amount
  ,extra
  ,mta_tax
  ,tip_amount
  ,tolls_amount
  ,ehail_fee
  ,NULL AS improvement_surcharge
  ,total_amount
  ,payment_type AS payment_type_id
  ,NULL AS trip_type_id
  ,NULL AS pickup_location_id
  ,NULL AS dropoff_location_id
FROM green_tripdata0

UNION ALL

-- second schema 2015-01 to 2016-06
SELECT 
  vendor_id
  ,lpep_pickup_datetime AS pickup_datetime
  ,lpep_dropoff_datetime AS dropoff_datetime
  ,store_and_fwd_flag
  ,rate_code_id
  ,pickup_longitude
  ,pickup_latitude
  ,dropoff_longitude
  ,dropoff_latitude
  ,passenger_count
  ,trip_distance
  ,fare_amount
  ,extra
  ,mta_tax
  ,tip_amount
  ,tolls_amount
  ,ehail_fee
  ,improvement_surcharge
  ,total_amount
  ,payment_type AS payment_type_id
  ,NULL AS trip_type_id
  ,NULL AS pickup_location_id
  ,NULL AS dropoff_location_id
FROM green_tripdata1

UNION ALL

-- third schema 2016-07 +
SELECT 
  vendor_id
  ,lpep_pickup_datetime AS pickup_datetime
  ,lpep_dropoff_datetime AS dropoff_datetime
  ,store_and_fwd_flag
  ,rate_code_id
  ,NULL AS pickup_longitude
  ,NULL AS pickup_latitude
  ,NULL AS dropoff_longitude
  ,NULL AS dropoff_latitude
  ,passenger_count
  ,trip_distance
  ,fare_amount
  ,extra
  ,mta_tax
  ,tip_amount
  ,tolls_amount
  ,ehail_fee
  ,improvement_surcharge
  ,total_amount
  ,payment_type AS payment_type_id
  ,NULL AS trip_type_id
  ,pickup_location_id
  ,dropoff_location_id
FROM green_tripdata2
```

Then we can define a `SQLTransform` stage to execute the query:

```json
{
  "type": "SQLTransform",
  "name": "merge green_tripdata_* to create a full trips",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/job/1/trips.sql",
  "outputView": "trips",            
  "persist": false
}
```

A snapshot of what we have done so far is `tutorial/job/1/nyctaxi.ipynb`.

## Glob Pattern Matching

Arc allows for pattern matching of file names including the standard wildcard (`green_tripdata_*.csv`) or more advanced [Glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29) matching. Glob can be used to select subsets of data in a directory but generally we recommend using directories and wildcards such as `green_tripdata/0/*.csv` to easily separate data schema versions.

#### Small Dataset

| dataset | schema | glob pattern |
|---------|--------|-----------------------|
|green_tripdata|0|`green_tripdata_{2013-{08,09}}.csv`|
|green_tripdata|1|`green_tripdata_{2015-{01}}.csv`|
|green_tripdata|2|`green_tripdata_{2016-{07}}.csv`|
|yellow_tripdata|0|`yellow_tripdata_{2009-{01}}.csv`|
|yellow_tripdata|1|`yellow_tripdata_{2009-{01}}.csv`|
|yellow_tripdata|2|`yellow_tripdata_{2016-{07}}.csv`|

#### Full Dataset

| dataset | schema | glob pattern |
|---------|--------|-----------------------|
|green_tripdata|0|`green_tripdata_{2013-*,2014-*}.csv`|
|green_tripdata|1|`green_tripdata_{2015-*,2016-{01,02,03,04,05,06}}.csv`|
|green_tripdata|2|`green_tripdata_{2016-{07,08,09,10,11,12},2017-*}.csv`|
|yellow_tripdata|0|`yellow_tripdata_{2009-*,2010-*,2011-*,2012-*,2013-*,2014-*}.csv`|
|yellow_tripdata|1|`yellow_tripdata_{2015-*,2016-{01,02,03,04,05,06}}.csv`|
|yellow_tripdata|2|`yellow_tripdata_{2016-{07,08,09,10,11,12}}.csv`|

## Add the rest of the tables

Go ahead and:

- add the file loading for the `yellow_tripdata`. There should be 3 stages for each schema load (`DelimitedExtract`, `TypingTransform`, `SQLValidate`) and a total of 7 schema versions so 21 stages just to read and safely type the data.
- modify the `SQLTransform` to include the new datasets.
- run the new version of the job. You may need to increase the RAM you have allocated to Arc.

A snapshot of what has been built so far is `tutorial/job/2/nyctaxi.ipynb`.

## Dealing with Empty Datasets

So if you executed the same job as the one that is `tutorial/job/2/` the previous job should have failed with `"messages":["DelimitedExtract has produced 0 columns and no schema has been provided to create an empty dataframe."]` as the second Uber directory (`data/uber_tripdata/1`) is empty (that was deliberately created to demonstrate this functionality). This is the other part of Schema Evolution we are trying to address: a pre-emptive schema. 

Sometimes you want to deploy a change to production before the files arrive and either the job fails or does not include that new data once it starts arriving. Arc supports this by allowing you to specify a schema for an empty dataset so that if no data arrives in a target `inputURI` directory an empty dataset with the correct columns and column types is emited so that all subsequent stages that depend on that dataset execute without failure.

To fix this issue add a `schemaURI` key which points to the same metadata file used by the subsequent `TypingTransform` stage:

```json
{
  "type": "DelimitedExtract",
  "name": "extract data from uber_tripdata/1",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/data/uber_tripdata/1/*",
  "schemaURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/meta/uber_tripdata/1/uber_tripdata.json",
  "outputView": "uber_tripdata1_raw",            
  "delimiter": "Comma",
  "quote": "DoubleQuote",
  "header": true
}
``` 

Also because we are testing that file for data quality using `SQLValidate` we need to change the SQL statement to be able to deal with empty datasets by adding a `COALESCE` to the first return value:

```sql
SELECT
  COALESCE(SUM(error) = 0, TRUE) AS valid
  ,TO_JSON(
    NAMED_STRUCT(
      'count', COUNT(error),
      'errors', SUM(error)
    )
  ) AS message
FROM (
  SELECT 
    CASE 
      WHEN SIZE(_errors) > 0 THEN 1 
      ELSE 0 
    END AS error 
  FROM ${table_name}
) input_table
```

Run this job and once it completes you should see in the logs: `"records":40540347`.

A snapshot of what we have done so far is `tutorial/job/3/nyctaxi.ipynb`.

## Reference Data

As the business problem is better understood it is common to see [normalization of data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization). For example, in the `yellow_tripdata0` in the early datasets `payment_type` was a `string` field which led to values which were variations on the same intent like `cash` and `CASH`. In the later datasets the `payment_type` has been normailized into a dataset which maps the `'cash'` type to the value `2`. To normalise this data we first need to load a lookup table which is going to define the rules on how to map `payment_type` to `payment_type_id`. 

So add these tables to be extracted from the included `data/reference` directory. They are small but we will be using them potentially a lot of times so set `"persist": true`.

```json
{
  "type": "JSONExtract",
  "name": "load payment_type_id reference table",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/data/reference/payment_type_id.json",
  "outputView": "payment_type_id",            
  "persist": true,
  "multiLine": false
}
```
```json
{
  "type": "JSONExtract",
  "name": "load cab_type_id reference table",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/data/reference/cab_type_id.json",
  "outputView": "cab_type_id",            
  "persist": true,
  "multiLine": false
}
```
```json
{
  "type": "JSONExtract",
  "name": "load vendor_id reference table",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/data/reference/vendor_id.json",
  "outputView": "vendor_id",            
  "persist": true,
  "multiLine": false
} 
```


{{< note title="JSON multiLine" >}}
In early versions of Spark the only option for `json` datasets was to use a `json` format called [jsonlines](http://jsonlines.org/) which requires each `json` object to be on a single line and multiple `json` objects could appear by having multiple lines of `json` data. This mode can still be enabled by setting `"multiLine": false` but the default in Spark ETL is a single `json` object per file. For reference data, like the data loaded above, we have used a `jsonlines` file to load multiple records in a single json file.
{{</note>}}

The main culprit of non-normalized data is the `yellow_tripdata0` dataset so let's add a `SQLTransform` stage which will do a `LEFT JOIN` to the new reference data then a `SQLValidate` stage to check that all of our refrence table lookups were successful (think foreign key integrity). The use of a `LEFT JOIN` over an `INNER JOIN` is that we don't want to filter out data from `yellow_tripdata0` that doesn't have a lookup value.

```json
{
  "type": "SQLTransform",
  "name": "perform lookups for yellow_tripdata0 reference tables",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/job/4/yellow_tripdata0_enrich.sql",
  "outputView": "yellow_tripdata0_enriched",            
  "persist": true
}
```
```json
{
  "type": "SQLValidate",
  "name": "ensure that yellow_tripdata0 reference table lookups were successful",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/job/4/yellow_tripdata0_enrich_validate.sql"
}
```

Where `job/4/yellow_tripdata0_enrich.sql` does the `LEFT JOIN`s:

```sql
SELECT 
  yellow_tripdata0.vendor_name
  ,vendor_id.vendor_id
  ,trip_pickup_datetime AS pickup_datetime
  ,trip_dropoff_datetime AS dropoff_datetime
  ,store_and_fwd_flag
  ,rate_code_id
  ,start_lon AS pickup_longitude
  ,start_lat AS pickup_latitude
  ,end_lon AS dropoff_longitude
  ,end_lat AS dropoff_latitude
  ,passenger_count
  ,trip_distance
  ,fare_amt AS fare_amount
  ,surcharge AS extra
  ,mta_tax
  ,tip_amount
  ,tolls_amount
  ,NULL AS ehail_fee
  ,NULL AS improvement_surcharge
  ,total_amount
  ,LOWER(yellow_tripdata0.payment_type) AS payment_type
  ,payment_type_id.payment_type_id
  ,NULL AS trip_type
  ,NULL AS pickup_nyct2010_gid
  ,NULL AS dropoff_nyct2010_gid
  ,NULL AS pickup_location_id
  ,NULL AS dropoff_location_id
FROM yellow_tripdata0
LEFT JOIN vendor_id ON yellow_tripdata0.vendor_name = vendor_id.vendor
LEFT JOIN payment_type_id ON LOWER(yellow_tripdata0.payment_type) = payment_type_id.payment_type
```

... and then `SQLValidate` verifies that there are no missing values. This query will also collect up the distinct list of missing values so they can be logged and added manually added to the lookup table if required.

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(null_vendor_id) = 0 AND SUM(null_payment_type_id) = 0 AS valid
  ,TO_JSON(
    NAMED_STRUCT(
      'null_vendor_id'
      ,SUM(null_vendor_id)
      ,'null_vendor_name'
      ,COLLECT_LIST(DISTINCT null_vendor_name)
      ,'null_payment_type_id'
      ,SUM(null_payment_type_id)
      ,'null_payment_type'
      ,COLLECT_LIST(DISTINCT null_payment_type)
    )
  ) AS message
FROM (
  SELECT 
    CASE WHEN vendor_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS null_vendor_id
    ,CASE WHEN vendor_id IS NULL THEN vendor_name ELSE NULL END AS null_vendor_name
    ,CASE WHEN payment_type_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS null_payment_type_id
    ,CASE WHEN payment_type_id IS NULL THEN payment_type ELSE NULL END AS null_payment_type
  FROM yellow_tripdata0_enriched
) valid
```

Which will succeed with `"message":{"null_payment_type":[],"null_payment_type_id":0,"null_vendor_id":0,"null_vendor_name":[]}`. 

So now we have a job which will merge all the `*tripdata` datasets into a single master `trips` dataset.

A snapshot of what we have done so far is `tutorial/job/4/nyctaxi.ipynb`.


## Saving Data

The final step is to do something with the merged data. This could be any of the [Load](/load/) stages but for our use case we will do a [ParquetLoad](/load/#parquetload). [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) is a great because:

- it is a columnar data format which means that when it is read by subsequent Spark jobs you can only read the columns that are required vastly reducing the amount of data moved across a network and that has to be processed.
- it retains full data types and metadata so that you don't have to keep converting text to correctly typed data
- it supports data partitioning and pushdown which also reduces the amount of data required to be processed

Here is the stage we will add which writes the trips dataset to a `parquet` file on disk. It will also be partitioned by `vendor_id` so that if you were doing analysis on only one of the vendors then Spark could easily read only that data and ignore the other vendors.

```json
{
    "type": "ParquetLoad",
    "name": "write trips back to filesystem",
    "environments": ["production", "test"],
    "inputView": "trips",
    "outputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/data/output/trips.parquet",
    "numPartitions": 100,
    "partitionBy": [
        "vendor_id"
    ]
}
```

A snapshot of what we have done so far is `tutorial/job/5/nyctaxi.ipynb`.

## Applying Machine Learning

There are multiple ways to execute Machine Learning using Arc:

- [HTTPTransform](/transform/#httptransform) allows calling an externally hosted model via HTTP.
- [TensorFlowServingTransform](/transform/#tensorflowservingtransform) allows calling a model hosted in a TensorFlow Serving container.
- [MLTransform](/transform/#mltransform) allows executing pretrained Spark ML model.

Assuming you have executed the job up to stage 5 we will use the `trips.parquet` file to train a new Spark ML model to attempt to predict the fare based on other input values. It is suggested to use a SQL statement to perform feature creation as even though SQL is clumsy compared with the brevity of Python Pandas it is automatically parallelizable by Spark and so can easily perform on `1` or `n` CPU cores without modification. It is also very easy to find people who can understand the logic:

```sql
-- enrich the data by:
-- - filtering bad data
-- - one-hot encode hour component of pickup_datetime
-- - one-hot encode dayofweek component of pickup_datetime
-- - calculate duration in seconds
-- - adding flag to indicate whether pickup/dropoff within jfk airport bounding box
SELECT 
  *
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 0 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_0
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 1 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_1
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 2 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_2
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 3 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_3
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 4 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_4
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 5 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_5
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 6 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_6
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 7 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_7
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 8 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_8
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 9 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_9
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 10 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_10
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 11 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_11
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 12 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_12
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 13 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_13
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 14 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_14
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 15 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_15
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 16 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_16
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 17 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_17
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 18 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_18
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 19 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_19
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 20 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_20
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 21 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_21
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 22 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_22
  ,CAST(HOUR(pickup_datetime) = 23 AS INT) AS pickup_hour_23
  ,CAST(DAYOFWEEK(pickup_datetime) = 0 AS INT) AS pickup_dayofweek_0
  ,CAST(DAYOFWEEK(pickup_datetime) = 1 AS INT) AS pickup_dayofweek_1
  ,CAST(DAYOFWEEK(pickup_datetime) = 2 AS INT) AS pickup_dayofweek_2
  ,CAST(DAYOFWEEK(pickup_datetime) = 3 AS INT) AS pickup_dayofweek_3
  ,CAST(DAYOFWEEK(pickup_datetime) = 4 AS INT) AS pickup_dayofweek_4
  ,CAST(DAYOFWEEK(pickup_datetime) = 5 AS INT) AS pickup_dayofweek_5
  ,CAST(DAYOFWEEK(pickup_datetime) = 6 AS INT) AS pickup_dayofweek_6
  ,UNIX_TIMESTAMP(dropoff_datetime) - UNIX_TIMESTAMP(pickup_datetime) AS duration
  ,CASE
      WHEN 
          (pickup_latitude < 40.651381 
          AND pickup_latitude > 40.640668
          AND pickup_longitude < -73.776283
          AND pickup_longitude > -73.794694)
          OR
          (dropoff_latitude < 40.651381 
          AND dropoff_latitude > 40.640668
          AND dropoff_longitude < -73.776283
          AND dropoff_longitude > -73.794694)           
      THEN 1 
      ELSE 0
  END AS jfk
FROM trips
WHERE trip_distance > 0
AND pickup_longitude IS NOT NULL
AND pickup_latitude IS NOT NULL
AND dropoff_longitude IS NOT NULL
AND dropoff_latitude IS NOT NULL
```

To execute the training load the `/job/6/New York City Taxi Fare Prediction SparkML.ipynb` notebook. It is commented and will describe the process to execute the SQL above to prepare the training dataset and train a model.

Once done the model can be executed in the notebook:

```json
{
  "type": "SQLTransform",
  "name": "merge green_tripdata_* to create a full trips",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/job/6/trips_enriched.sql",
  "outputView": "trips_enriched",            
  "persist": false
},
{
  "type": "MLTransform",
  "name": "apply machine learning prediction model",
  "environments": [
    "production",
    "test"
  ],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/job/6/trips_enriched.model",
  "inputView": "trips_enriched",
  "outputView": "trips_scored"
}
```

You can now [Load](/load) the output dataset into a target like `parquet` or `JDBCLoad` into a caching database for serving.

A snapshot of what we have done so far is `tutorial/job/6/nyctaxi.ipynb`.
